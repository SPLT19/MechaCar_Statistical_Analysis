# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis with R

## Overview
The following analysis was performed to review a production data for insigths that could help troubleshoot issues with a manufacturing process. 
Statistical analysis included: sumamary statistics, multiple linear regression analysis, t-test and design of stadistical analysis comparing the employer data against other manufacturers data.

### Tools and resources: 
csv datasets [MechaCarMpg](MechaCar_mpg.csv) [SuspensionCoil](Suspension_Coil.csv) , R, RStudio, and libraries as Tidiverse, Dpylr.  


# Results

## Linear Regression: Relevant variables related to MPG Prediction of MechaCar prototypes

The first step consisted in using Multiple Linear Regression model to identify statistical significant variables assosiated to miles per gallon (mpg) for the newest AutoRUs prototype. 

Dataset consisted of 6 rows that included variables like vehicle length, vehicle weight, cpoiler angle, ground clearance, AWD and mpg. 
Results from linear regression are as seen in the following image

Written Summary
In your README, create a subheading, ## Linear Regression to Predict MPG, and write a short summary using a screenshot of the output from the linear regression, and address the following questions:

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?



## Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis (30 points)
Deliverable 2 Instructions
Written Summary
In your README, create a subheading ## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils, and write a short summary using screenshots from your total_summary and lot_summary dataframes, and address the following question:

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?


## Deliverable 3: T-Tests on Suspension Coils (20 points)
Deliverable 3 Instructions

n your README, create a subheading ## T-Tests on Suspension Coils, then briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.





## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.
In your description, address the following questions:
What metric or metrics are you going to test?
What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
What data is needed to run the statistical test?
